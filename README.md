# Freespee assignment

This project is a solution to a Freespee frontend assignment. The assignement is described [here](frontend.pdf).

The boilerplate for this express - babel setup is taken from [vmasto's express-babel](https://codeclimate.com/github/vmasto/express-babel).

The solution to the assignment is found in
